# Now, you are on the branch created from the latest tag

# Perform any actions or updates you need here

# When a new tag is created by the developer, update the branch
# For example, if the new tag is "v1.1.0"
new_tag="v1.1.0"

# Check if the branch already exists
if git rev-parse --verify "$branch_name" >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    # If the branch exists, switch to it

    git merge "$new_tag"
else
    # If the branch doesn't exist, create a new branch from the new tag
    git checkout -b "$branch_name" "$new_tag"
fi

# Now, the branch is updated with the changes from the new tag

# Perform any additional actions or updates if needed

# Note: This script is a basic example and may need to be adapted based on your specific use case and Git workflow.
