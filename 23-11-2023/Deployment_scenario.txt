I have a repository where i have my code base of multiple microservices, and the complete project is used by many clients independently, when there is an update or change in projects we need to deploy the application to each client at different intervals of time, this means each client might have different versions of applications and we need to keep track of our deployments and we need to update the projects according to the changes required. The main point hre is the whole project is used by every client and everyone wants to access it but few need updates during come specific point of time. How to manage this,and the main point here is the whole project is hosted on the same server and every clients access the same project through same server and we dont need to make any dtabase migrations as database is maintained by the client at their premises and we will communicate with database through an API.

give me consolidated plan comprising all the provided details
