To achieve that we can follow the below steps:

1. creating a directory structure

/var/www/html/
|-- app/
|   |-- v1/
|   |-- v2/
|   |-- v3/

2. Use VirtualHost config files (ex: httpd.conf) to configure the clients to re-direct to specific version like by maintaining a sub-domain for each version

    <VirtualHost *:80>
        ServerName v1.yourdomain.com
        DocumentRoot /var/www/html/app/v1
    </VirtualHost>

    <VirtualHost *:80>
        ServerName v2.yourdomain.com
        DocumentRoot /var/www/html/app/v2
    </VirtualHost>

    <VirtualHost *:80>
        ServerName v3.yourdomain.com
        DocumentRoot /var/www/html/app/v3
    </VirtualHost>

3. Creating and deleting folders when thers is a change in version.
    For that we can write a script to create new version of application by creating a new folders.
    Refer folder_management.sh
