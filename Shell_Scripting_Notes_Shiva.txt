Shell Scripting:

variables and comments:

- comments start with # 
- variables are declared as "var_name", and to access values we use $var_name

There are few specific restrictions on using some words as variables as they are used as system variables such as bash,bash_version,home,pwd,etc.

Languages for scripting:
1.bash
2.python

configuration files - yml,yaml
